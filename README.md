# OOP Calculator with GUI

This project is a simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter, following an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- **Core Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with Tkinter, offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulates functionality in classes for better organization and reusability.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.
2. Tkinter is included by default with Python. No additional installation is required.

## Running the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fexilgonzo/OOPCalculatorWithGUI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd OOPCalculatorWithGUI
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 oop_calculator_gui.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add advanced operations such as power, modulus, and square root.
- Include themes or styling options for the GUI.
- Enhance error handling and input validation.

## About
This project demonstrates how object-oriented programming can be combined with GUI frameworks like Tkinter to create interactive Python applications.
